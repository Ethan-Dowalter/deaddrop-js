#  deaddrop-js

A deaddrop utility written in Typescript. Put files in a database behind a password to be retrieved at a later date.

This is a part of the University of Wyoming's Secure Software Design Course (Spring 2023). This is the base repository to be forked and updated for various assignments. Alternative language versions are available in:
- [Go](https://github.com/andey-robins/deaddrop-go)
- [Rust](https://github.com/andey-robins/deaddrop-rs)

## Versioning

`deaddrop-js` is built with:
- node v18.13.0

## Usage

`npm run build && node dist/index.js --help` for instructions

Then run `node dist/index.js --new --user <username here>` and you will be prompted to create the initial password.

## Database

Data gets stored into the local database file dd.db. This file will not by synched to git repos. Delete this file if you don't set up a user properly on the first go

## Mitigation

The security optimization that I implemented was encrypting the messages with AES symmetric encryption before they get stored in the database. I simply used a long random string for the secret key to encrypt and decrypt the messages. If an attacker got access to the database file AND the source code, they could easily decrypt the messages, but this still adds an additional layer of security so that they would need both in order to read all the messages.
